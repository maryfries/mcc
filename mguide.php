                <h2>Choosing a Standards-Based Mathematics Curriculum</h2>
                <p>by Lynn T. Goldsmith, June Mark, and Ilene Kantrov</p>
                <p><span class="title">Choosing a Standards-Based Mathematics Curriculum</span> is a guide for the selection and implementation of instructional materials based on the NCTM Standards. This guide is intended for use by assistant superintendents, curriculum coordinators, mathematics supervisors, lead teachers, department heads, and other educators responsible for the curriculum review and selection process within a district. This 182-page guide describes a process for considering and reviewing standards-based mathematics programs and raises questions and issues for readers to consider in their own processes, such as setting appropriate evaluation criteria, assessing district needs and resources, piloting materials before selection, and planning professional development and teacher support to facilitate implementation.</p>
