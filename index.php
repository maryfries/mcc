Our projects explore and analyze how curriculum decisions are  made in K&ndash;12 mathematics programs, provide resources that support good curriculum  selection and implementation, and connect research and practice in mathematics  instruction. Funded by the National Science Foundation since 1997, the center  is based at Education Development Center, Inc. </p>
